Some hopefully useful notes...

git status

git init

git add <file>
    - adds file to git to be tracked.
    - needs to be done each time after a tracked change is desired.

git commit -m "commit msg"

git branch
    - creates branch for changes without affecting master.

git remote add origin https://github.com/<user>/<git>
    - adds remote repo URL to local git so repos can be pushed/pulled.

git push -u origin master
    - pushes local repo to github (origin)
    - 'origin' is basically a 'link' to the URL so doesn't need to be typed out.

git remote remove origin

git pull origin master.
    - pulls copy from github and syncs local git

git log
    - shows the list of commits for branches.

git checkout <branch>
    -switch between branches
